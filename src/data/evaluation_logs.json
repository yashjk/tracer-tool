			"question": "What are the global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion?",
			"ground_truth": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion are significant. The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally. Organizations and activists worldwide are concerned that the ruling may inspire anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries. The ruling has also hindered progressive law reform and the implementation of abortion guidelines in certain African countries. Furthermore, the ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, empowering anti-abortion actors to undermine human rights protections.",
			"answer": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion can be significant, as it sets a precedent for other countries and influences the global discourse on reproductive rights. Here are some potential implications:\n\n1. Influence on other countries: The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws. It can provide legal arguments and reasoning that advocates for reproductive rights can use to challenge restrictive abortion laws in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n2. Strengthening of global reproductive rights movements: A favorable ruling by the Supreme Court can energize and empower reproductive rights movements worldwide. It can serve as a rallying point for activists and organizations advocating for women's rights, leading to increased mobilization and advocacy efforts globally.\n\n3. Counteracting anti-abortion movements: Conversely, a ruling that restricts abortion rights can embolden anti-abortion movements globally. It can provide legitimacy to their arguments and encourage similar restrictive measures in other countries, potentially leading to a rollback of existing reproductive rights.\n\n4. Impact on international aid and policies: The Supreme Court's ruling can influence international aid and policies related to reproductive health. It can shape the priorities and funding decisions of donor countries and organizations, potentially leading to increased support for reproductive rights initiatives or conversely, restrictions on funding for abortion-related services.\n\n5. Shaping international human rights standards: The ruling can contribute to the development of international human rights standards regarding reproductive rights. It can influence the interpretation and application of existing human rights treaties and conventions, potentially strengthening the recognition of reproductive rights as fundamental human rights globally.\n\n6. Global health implications: The Supreme Court's ruling can have implications for global health outcomes, particularly in countries with restrictive abortion laws. It can impact the availability and accessibility of safe and legal abortion services, potentially leading to an increase in unsafe abortions and related health complications.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific implications will depend on the nature of the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent actions taken by governments, activists, and organizations both within and outside the United States.",

			"question": "What are the global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion?",
			"ground_truth": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion are significant. The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally. Organizations and activists worldwide are concerned that the ruling may inspire anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries. The ruling has also hindered progressive law reform and the implementation of abortion guidelines in certain African countries. Furthermore, the ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, empowering anti-abortion actors to undermine human rights protections.",
			"answer": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion can be significant, as it sets a precedent for other countries and influences the global discourse on reproductive rights. Here are some potential implications:\n\n1. Influence on other countries: The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws. It can provide legal arguments and reasoning that advocates for reproductive rights can use to challenge restrictive abortion laws in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n2. Strengthening of global reproductive rights movements: A favorable ruling by the Supreme Court can energize and empower reproductive rights movements worldwide. It can serve as a rallying point for activists and organizations advocating for women's rights, leading to increased mobilization and advocacy efforts globally.\n\n3. Counteracting anti-abortion movements: Conversely, a ruling that restricts abortion rights can embolden anti-abortion movements globally. It can provide legitimacy to their arguments and encourage similar restrictive measures in other countries, potentially leading to a rollback of existing reproductive rights.\n\n4. Impact on international aid and policies: The Supreme Court's ruling can influence international aid and policies related to reproductive health. It can shape the priorities and funding decisions of donor countries and organizations, potentially leading to increased support for reproductive rights initiatives or conversely, restrictions on funding for abortion-related services.\n\n5. Shaping international human rights standards: The ruling can contribute to the development of international human rights standards regarding reproductive rights. It can influence the interpretation and application of existing human rights treaties and conventions, potentially strengthening the recognition of reproductive rights as fundamental human rights globally.\n\n6. Global health implications: The Supreme Court's ruling can have implications for global health outcomes, particularly in countries with restrictive abortion laws. It can impact the availability and accessibility of safe and legal abortion services, potentially leading to an increase in unsafe abortions and related health complications.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific implications will depend on the nature of the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent actions taken by governments, activists, and organizations both within and outside the United States.",

			"ground_truth": "According to the Carbon Majors database, the main contributors to GHG emissions and their role in global warming are fossil fuel companies. These companies, both state-owned and private, have produced almost a trillion tons of GHG emissions in 150 years. The database shows that 100 existing fossil fuel companies, along with eight that no longer exist, are responsible for 71% of all GHG emissions since 1988. In the Americas, the private companies that have contributed the most emissions are ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Peabody, all from the United States. Among state-owned companies in the Americas, the largest emitter is Mexican company Pemex, followed by Venezuelan company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. It is important to note that while people with fewer resources, particularly from countries in the global South, do not significantly contribute to climate change, they are the ones most affected by its impacts. Approximately half of the global population lives in areas that are \"very vulnerable\" to climate change, and it is people with limited development opportunities who face the greatest risks. This unequal impact disproportionately affects the human rights of those with fewer resources and greater vulnerability in the context of climate change in the global South.

			"question": "What factors have contributed to the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua?",
			"ground_truth": "The factors that have contributed to the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua include arrests and harassment of human rights defenders, restrictive NGO laws, violent repression of protests, closure of civil society organizations and community centers, expropriation of belongings and premises, criminalization of social organizing and mobilization, restrictions on freedom of expression, implementation of repressive laws, constant threats of arrest and detention, restrictions on social media, and the imposition of silence through violence and repression.",
			"answer": "There are several factors that have contributed to the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua:\n\n1. Repressive government policies: The Nicaraguan government, under President Daniel Ortega, has implemented a series of repressive policies that have targeted civil society organizations. These policies include restrictive laws, such as the Foreign Agents Law, which requires organizations receiving foreign funding to register as \"foreign agents\" and submit detailed financial reports. This has created a climate of fear and uncertainty for many organizations, leading to self-censorship and a decline in their activities.\n\n2. Harassment and intimidation: Civil society organizations in Nicaragua have faced harassment and intimidation from government authorities, including surveillance, arbitrary arrests, and physical attacks. Human rights defenders and activists have been particularly targeted, with many facing threats to their personal safety and the safety of their families. This has made it difficult for organizations to operate freely and has deterred many individuals from getting involved in civil society work.\n\n3. Lack of funding: The repressive policies and climate of fear have also made it difficult for civil society organizations to secure funding. Many international donors have been reluctant to support organizations in Nicaragua due to concerns about the government's crackdown on civil society. This has led to a decline in resources available for organizations to carry out their work, including advocacy, research, and service provision.\n\n4. Legal restrictions: The Nicaraguan government has implemented a series of legal restrictions that have made it difficult for civil society organizations to operate. These include laws that limit freedom of association, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly. Organizations that are critical of the government or engage in activities deemed \"political\" have faced increased scrutiny and legal challenges, further limiting their ability to operate independently.\n\n5. Polarization and division: The political situation in Nicaragua has become increasingly polarized, with the government cracking down on dissent and opposition voices. This has created a climate of fear and mistrust, making it difficult for civil society organizations to collaborate and coordinate their efforts. The lack of unity and solidarity among civil society actors has weakened their collective impact and made it easier for the government to suppress their activities.\n\nOverall, the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua can be attributed to a combination of repressive government policies, harassment and intimidation, lack of funding, legal restrictions, and polarization. These factors have created a hostile environment for civil society, leading to a decline in their numbers and activities.",

			"question": "What are the consequences of criminalizing abortion for marginalized individuals?",
			"ground_truth": "The consequences of criminalizing abortion for marginalized individuals include increased stigma, lack of information, and disinformation. This can have severe and irreversible effects on these individuals. Girls and young women may be forced to carry pregnancies resulting from sexual violence due to a lack of knowledge about their rights. Marginalized individuals, such as those living in poverty, historically discriminated against, Indigenous and Afro-descendent women, migrants, and refugees, are disproportionately affected by abortion criminalization. The criminalization of abortion is a major factor contributing to the high number of unsafe abortions, which leads to increased maternal mortality and morbidity. Access to health services is undermined, resulting in preventable maternal deaths and complications. Marginalized individuals are forced to resort to unsafe clandestine abortion methods, putting their lives and health at risk. In Nigeria, restrictive abortion laws make it difficult to access safe abortion care.",
			"answer": "Criminalizing abortion can have severe consequences for marginalized individuals, particularly those who are already facing various forms of discrimination and inequality. Some of the consequences include:\n\n1. Health risks: When abortion is criminalized, individuals may resort to unsafe and illegal methods to terminate their pregnancies, leading to serious health complications and even death. Marginalized individuals, who often have limited access to healthcare and resources, are more likely to be affected by these risks.\n\n2. Economic burden: Marginalized individuals, who are more likely to face financial constraints, may struggle to afford safe and legal abortions in countries where it is criminalized. This can lead to increased financial burdens, as they may have to travel long distances or seek expensive underground services.\n\n3. Limited reproductive choices: Criminalizing abortion restricts individuals' reproductive choices and autonomy. Marginalized individuals, who already face various barriers to accessing healthcare and education, may be further limited in their ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\n\n4. Increased inequality: Criminalizing abortion disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, exacerbating existing inequalities. Women from low-income backgrounds, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural areas often face additional barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services, further widening the gap between privileged and marginalized groups.\n\n5. Criminalization of pregnancy: In some cases, criminalizing abortion can lead to the criminalization of pregnancy itself. This can result in the surveillance and punishment of pregnant individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, who may be subjected to invasive monitoring, discrimination, and even imprisonment for actions perceived as harmful to the fetus.\n\n6. Mental health impact: The criminalization of abortion can have significant psychological consequences for marginalized individuals. The stigma and shame associated with seeking illegal abortions or being unable to access safe services can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\n7. Reproductive injustice: Criminalizing abortion perpetuates reproductive injustice by denying marginalized individuals the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their reproductive health. It reinforces systemic inequalities and denies them the same reproductive rights and freedoms enjoyed by more privileged individuals.\n\nIt is important to note that these consequences are not limited to criminalizing abortion alone but are often intertwined with broader social, economic, and healthcare disparities faced by marginalized communities.",

			"ground_truth": "Amnesty International documented labor abuses in Qatar, including workers being permitted only one day off each month, threats of salary cuts for taking more rest time, failure to provide pay slips, and overcrowded and dirty living conditions. These labor abuses relate to the kafala system because the kafala system imposes tight restrictions on migrant workers' freedom of movement and ability to change jobs without their employer's permission. This system allows abusive employers to control their workforce by canceling residence permits, falsely reporting employees as absconding, and using non-compete clauses to prevent workers from changing jobs.",
			"answer": "Amnesty International has documented several labor abuses in Qatar, particularly in relation to the kafala system. The kafala system is a sponsorship-based employment system that ties migrant workers to their employers, giving employers significant control over their workers' lives and rights. Here are some of the labor abuses documented:\n\n1. Exploitative working conditions: Migrant workers in Qatar often face long working hours, with some working up to 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week. They are also subjected to dangerous and hazardous working conditions, especially in the construction sector.\n\n2. Withheld wages: Many workers have reported that their employers withhold their wages for months, sometimes even years. This practice leaves workers in a vulnerable position, unable to leave their jobs or seek alternative employment.\n\n3. Passport confiscation: Employers often confiscate the passports of migrant workers, depriving them of their freedom of movement and making it difficult for them to leave the country or change jobs. This practice is a clear violation of workers' rights and leaves them trapped in exploitative situations.\n\n4. Forced labor and human trafficking: Amnesty International has documented cases of forced labor and human trafficking in Qatar. Some workers are deceived about the nature of their work or are forced to work against their will, often in conditions akin to modern-day slavery.\n\n5. Inadequate living conditions: Migrant workers in Qatar often live in overcrowded and unsanitary accommodation provided by their employers. These living conditions are substandard and do not meet basic human rights standards.\n\nThese labor abuses are directly linked to the kafala system, which gives employers excessive power and control over migrant workers. The system ties workers to their employers, making it difficult for them to assert their rights or seek redress for abuses. The kafala system creates a power imbalance that enables employers to exploit workers, leading to the documented labor abuses in Qatar.",
			"contexts": [

These include the unwritten \u2013 but often spoken \u2013 need for workers to secure \u201crelease papers\u201d, a resignation letter, or any equivalent of an NOC, from their current employers in order to successfully move jobs, and the malicious use by employers of the Labour Law\u2019s non-compete clause to effectively ban workers from changing jobs under the guise that they are going to work for direct competitors."

			"question": "What factors have contributed to the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua?",
			"ground_truth": "The factors that have contributed to the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua include arrests and harassment of human rights defenders, restrictive NGO laws, violent repression of protests, closure of civil society organizations and community centers, expropriation of belongings and premises, criminalization of social organizing and mobilization, restrictions on freedom of expression, implementation of repressive laws, constant threats of arrest and detention, restrictions on social media, and the imposition of silence through violence and repression.",
			"answer": "There are several factors that have contributed to the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua:\n\n1. Repressive government policies: The Nicaraguan government, under President Daniel Ortega, has implemented a series of repressive policies that have targeted civil society organizations. These policies include restrictive laws, such as the Foreign Agents Law, which requires organizations receiving foreign funding to register as \"foreign agents\" and submit detailed financial reports. This has created a climate of fear and uncertainty for many organizations, leading to self-censorship and a decline in their activities.\n\n2. Harassment and intimidation: Civil society organizations in Nicaragua have faced harassment and intimidation from government authorities, including surveillance, arbitrary arrests, and physical attacks. Human rights defenders and activists have been particularly targeted, with many facing threats to their personal safety and the safety of their families. This has made it difficult for organizations to operate freely and has deterred many individuals from getting involved in civil society work.\n\n3. Lack of funding: The repressive policies and climate of fear have also made it difficult for civil society organizations to secure funding. Many international donors have been reluctant to support organizations in Nicaragua due to concerns about the government's crackdown on civil society. This has led to a decline in resources available for organizations to carry out their work, including advocacy, research, and service provision.\n\n4. Legal restrictions: The Nicaraguan government has implemented a series of legal restrictions that have made it difficult for civil society organizations to operate. These include laws that limit freedom of association, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly. Organizations that are critical of the government or engage in activities deemed \"political\" have faced increased scrutiny and legal challenges, further limiting their ability to operate independently.\n\n5. Polarization and division: The political situation in Nicaragua has become increasingly polarized, with the government cracking down on dissent and opposition voices. This has created a climate of fear and mistrust, making it difficult for civil society organizations to collaborate and coordinate their efforts. The lack of unity and solidarity among civil society actors has weakened their collective impact and made it easier for the government to suppress their activities.\n\nOverall, the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua can be attributed to a combination of repressive government policies, harassment and intimidation, lack of funding, legal restrictions, and polarization. These factors have created a hostile environment for civil society, leading to a decline in their numbers and activities.",

			"question": "What are the consequences of criminalizing abortion for marginalized individuals?",
			"ground_truth": "The consequences of criminalizing abortion for marginalized individuals include increased stigma, lack of information, and disinformation. This can have severe and irreversible effects on these individuals. Girls and young women may be forced to carry pregnancies resulting from sexual violence due to a lack of knowledge about their rights. Marginalized individuals, such as those living in poverty, historically discriminated against, Indigenous and Afro-descendent women, migrants, and refugees, are disproportionately affected by abortion criminalization. The criminalization of abortion is a major factor contributing to the high number of unsafe abortions, which leads to increased maternal mortality and morbidity. Access to health services is undermined, resulting in preventable maternal deaths and complications. Marginalized individuals are forced to resort to unsafe clandestine abortion methods, putting their lives and health at risk. In Nigeria, restrictive abortion laws make it difficult to access safe abortion care.",
			"answer": "Criminalizing abortion can have severe consequences for marginalized individuals, particularly those who are already facing various forms of discrimination and inequality. Some of the consequences include:\n\n1. Health risks: When abortion is criminalized, individuals may resort to unsafe and illegal methods to terminate their pregnancies, leading to serious health complications and even death. Marginalized individuals, who often have limited access to healthcare and resources, are more likely to be affected by these risks.\n\n2. Economic burden: Marginalized individuals, who are more likely to face financial constraints, may struggle to afford safe and legal abortions in countries where it is criminalized. This can lead to increased financial burdens, as they may have to travel long distances or seek expensive underground services.\n\n3. Limited reproductive choices: Criminalizing abortion restricts individuals' reproductive choices and autonomy. Marginalized individuals, who already face various barriers to accessing healthcare and education, may be further limited in their ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\n\n4. Increased inequality: Criminalizing abortion disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, exacerbating existing inequalities. Women from low-income backgrounds, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural areas often face additional barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services, further widening the gap between privileged and marginalized groups.\n\n5. Criminalization of pregnancy: In some cases, criminalizing abortion can lead to the criminalization of pregnancy itself. This can result in the surveillance and punishment of pregnant individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, who may be subjected to invasive monitoring, discrimination, and even imprisonment for actions perceived as harmful to the fetus.\n\n6. Mental health impact: The criminalization of abortion can have significant psychological consequences for marginalized individuals. The stigma and shame associated with seeking illegal abortions or being unable to access safe services can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\n7. Reproductive injustice: Criminalizing abortion perpetuates reproductive injustice by denying marginalized individuals the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their reproductive health. It reinforces systemic inequalities and denies them the same reproductive rights and freedoms enjoyed by more privileged individuals.\n\nIt is important to note that these consequences are not limited to criminalizing abortion alone but are often intertwined with broader social, economic, and healthcare disparities faced by marginalized communities.",

This can include providing tips on how to evaluate the credibility of sources, recognizing misinformation, and understanding the importance of evidence-based information.\n\n6. Reporting and addressing misinformation: Social media platforms should have clear and accessible mechanisms for users to report misinformation related to sexual and reproductive health. They should promptly investigate and take appropriate action against accounts or content that spread false or harmful information.\n\n7. Accessibility and inclusivity: Social media companies should ensure that accurate sexual and reproductive health information is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities or from marginalized communities. They should consider the needs of diverse populations and provide information in multiple languages and formats.\n\n8. Continuous improvement: Social media companies should regularly evaluate and improve their policies, algorithms, and practices related to sexual and reproductive health information. They should stay updated with the latest research and feedback from users and experts to adapt their approaches and address emerging challenges.\n\nBy fulfilling these responsibilities, social media companies can play a crucial role in promoting accurate sexual and reproductive health information and empowering users to make informed decisions about their health.",
			"contexts": [
				"Social media companies involved in facilitating and moderating online content need to invest adequate resources in human oversight of artificial intelligence-driven content moderation systems to ensure all users can equally exercise their rights online, regardless of language and political views and ensure that they can access accurate sexual and reproductive health-related information, including on the right to abortion. They should also uphold their human rights responsibilities by engaging in human rights due diligence, including to address risks and abuses arising from their business model."

			"question": "What are the global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion?",
			"ground_truth": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion are significant. The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally. Organizations and activists worldwide are concerned that the ruling may inspire anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries. The ruling has also hindered progressive law reform and the implementation of abortion guidelines in certain African countries. Furthermore, the ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, empowering anti-abortion actors to undermine human rights protections.",
			"answer": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion can be significant, as it sets a precedent for other countries and influences the global discourse on reproductive rights. Here are some potential implications:\n\n1. Influence on other countries: The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws. It can provide legal arguments and reasoning that advocates for reproductive rights can use to challenge restrictive abortion laws in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n2. Strengthening of global reproductive rights movements: A favorable ruling by the Supreme Court can energize and empower reproductive rights movements worldwide. It can serve as a rallying point for activists and organizations advocating for women's rights, leading to increased mobilization and advocacy efforts globally.\n\n3. Counteracting anti-abortion movements: Conversely, a ruling that restricts abortion rights can embolden anti-abortion movements globally. It can provide legitimacy to their arguments and encourage similar restrictive measures in other countries, potentially leading to a rollback of existing reproductive rights.\n\n4. Impact on international aid and policies: The Supreme Court's ruling can influence international aid and policies related to reproductive health. It can shape the priorities and funding decisions of donor countries and organizations, potentially leading to increased support for reproductive rights initiatives or conversely, restrictions on funding for abortion-related services.\n\n5. Shaping international human rights standards: The ruling can contribute to the development of international human rights standards regarding reproductive rights. It can influence the interpretation and application of existing human rights treaties and conventions, potentially strengthening the recognition of reproductive rights as fundamental human rights globally.\n\n6. Global health implications: The Supreme Court's ruling can have implications for global health outcomes, particularly in countries with restrictive abortion laws. It can impact the availability and accessibility of safe and legal abortion services, potentially leading to an increase in unsafe abortions and related health complications.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific implications will depend on the nature of the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent actions taken by governments, activists, and organizations both within and outside the United States.",
			"contexts": [
				"- In 2022, the USA Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling that overturned 50 years of jurisprudence recognizing a constitutional right to abortion.\n- This decision has had a massive impact: one in three women and girls of reproductive age now live in states where abortion access is either totally or near-totally inaccessible.\n- The states with the most restrictive abortion laws have the weakest maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates.\n- The USA Supreme Court ruling has also had impacts beyond national borders due to the geopolitical and cultural influence wielded by the USA globally and the aid it funds.\n- SRR organizations and activists across the world have expressed fear about the ruling laying the groundwork for anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries.\n- Advocates have also observed the ruling's impact on progressive law reform and the stalling of the adoption and enforcement of abortion guidelines in certain African countries.\n- The ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, emboldening anti-abortion state and non-state actors to undermine human rights protections."

Repressive government policies: The Nicaraguan government, under President Daniel Ortega, has implemented a series of repressive policies that have targeted civil society organizations. These policies include restrictive laws, such as the Foreign Agents Law, which requires organizations receiving foreign funding to register as \"foreign agents\" and submit detailed financial reports. This has created a climate of fear and uncertainty for many organizations, leading to self-censorship and a decline in their activities.\n\n2. Harassment and intimidation: Civil society organizations in Nicaragua have faced harassment and intimidation from government authorities, including surveillance, arbitrary arrests, and physical attacks. Human rights defenders and activists have been particularly targeted, with many facing threats to their personal safety and the safety of their families. This has made it difficult for organizations to operate freely and has deterred many individuals from getting involved in civil society work.\n\n3. Lack of funding: The repressive policies and climate of fear have also made it difficult for civil society organizations to secure funding. Many international donors have been reluctant to support organizations in Nicaragua due to concerns about the government's crackdown on civil society. This has led to a decline in resources available for organizations to carry out their work, including advocacy, research, and service provision.\n\n4. Legal restrictions: The Nicaraguan government has implemented a series of legal restrictions that have made it difficult for civil society organizations to operate. These include laws that limit freedom of association, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly. Organizations that are critical of the government or engage in activities deemed \"political\" have faced increased scrutiny and legal challenges, further limiting their ability to operate independently.\n\n5. Polarization and division: The political situation in Nicaragua has become increasingly polarized, with the government cracking down on dissent and opposition voices. This has created a climate of fear and mistrust, making it difficult for civil society organizations to collaborate and coordinate their efforts. The lack of unity and solidarity among civil society actors has weakened their collective impact and made it easier for the government to suppress their activities.\n\nOverall, the decline of independent civil society organizations in Nicaragua can be attributed to a combination of repressive government policies, harassment and intimidation, lack of funding, legal restrictions, and polarization. These factors have created a hostile environment for civil society, leading to a decline in their numbers and activities.\nsentences: 0:1.

Some of the consequences include:\n\n1. Health risks: When abortion is criminalized, individuals may resort to unsafe and illegal methods to terminate their pregnancies, leading to serious health complications and even death. Marginalized individuals, who often have limited access to healthcare and resources, are more likely to be affected by these risks.\n\n2. Economic burden: Marginalized individuals, who are more likely to face financial constraints, may struggle to afford safe and legal abortions in countries where it is criminalized. This can lead to increased financial burdens, as they may have to travel long distances or seek expensive underground services.\n\n3. Limited reproductive choices: Criminalizing abortion restricts individuals' reproductive choices and autonomy. Marginalized individuals, who already face various barriers to accessing healthcare and education, may be further limited in their ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\n\n4. Increased inequality: Criminalizing abortion disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, exacerbating existing inequalities. Women from low-income backgrounds, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural areas often face additional barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services, further widening the gap between privileged and marginalized groups.\n\n5. Criminalization of pregnancy: In some cases, criminalizing abortion can lead to the criminalization of pregnancy itself. This can result in the surveillance and punishment of pregnant individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, who may be subjected to invasive monitoring, discrimination, and even imprisonment for actions perceived as harmful to the fetus.\n\n6. Mental health impact: The criminalization of abortion can have significant psychological consequences for marginalized individuals. The stigma and shame associated with seeking illegal abortions or being unable to access safe services can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\n7. Reproductive injustice: Criminalizing abortion perpetuates reproductive injustice by denying marginalized individuals the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their reproductive health. It reinforces systemic inequalities and denies them the same reproductive rights and freedoms enjoyed by more privileged individuals.\n\nIt is important to note that these consequences are not limited to criminalizing abortion alone but are often intertwined with broader social, economic, and healthcare disparities faced by marginalized communities.\nsentences: 0:Criminalizing abortion can have severe consequences for marginalized individuals, particularly those who are already facing various forms of discrimination and inequality. \n1:1.

			"question": "Which companies are the main contributors to GHG emissions and their role in global warming according to the Carbon Majors database?",
			"ground_truth": "According to the Carbon Majors database, the main contributors to GHG emissions and their role in global warming are fossil fuel companies. These companies, both state-owned and private, have produced almost a trillion tons of GHG emissions in 150 years. The database shows that 100 existing fossil fuel companies, along with eight that no longer exist, are responsible for 71% of all GHG emissions since 1988. In the Americas, the private companies that have contributed the most emissions are ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Peabody, all from the United States. Among state-owned companies in the Americas, the largest emitter is Mexican company Pemex, followed by Venezuelan company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. It is important to note that while people with fewer resources, particularly from countries in the global South, do not significantly contribute to climate change, they are the ones most affected by its impacts. Approximately half of the global population lives in areas that are \"very vulnerable\" to climate change, and it is people with limited development opportunities who face the greatest risks. This unequal impact disproportionately affects the human rights of those with fewer resources and greater vulnerability in the context of climate change in the global South. Additionally, between 2010 and 2020, human mortality due to climate disasters was 15 times higher in vulnerable regions and populations.",
			"answer": "According to the Carbon Majors database, the main contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their role in global warming are primarily fossil fuel companies.

				"- Fossil fuel companies, whether state or private, play a key role in the emissions that drive global warming.\n- According to the Carbon Majors database, 100 existing fossil fuel companies (and eight that no longer exist) have produced almost a trillion tons of GHG emissions in 150 years.\n- These 100 companies are responsible for 71% of all GHG emissions since 1988.\n- In the Americas, the private companies responsible for the most emissions during this period, according to the database, are from the United States: ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Peabody.\n- The largest emitter amongst state-owned companies in the Americas is Mexican company Pemex, followed by Venezuelan company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.\n- Despite the fact that people with fewer resources, in particular from countries in the global South, do not make significant contributions to climate change, it is these people who are most affected by it.\n- Approximately half of the global population lives in areas that are \"very vulnerable\" to climate change, and it is people with considerable development constraints who are most exposed.\n- This disproportionately affects the human rights of people with fewer resources and greater risk in the context of climate change in the global South.\n- Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality due to climate disasters was 15 times higher in vulnerable regions and populations."

			"ground_truth": "Amnesty International documented labor abuses in Qatar, including workers being permitted only one day off each month, threats of salary cuts for taking more rest time, failure to provide pay slips, and overcrowded and dirty living conditions. These labor abuses relate to the kafala system because the kafala system imposes tight restrictions on migrant workers' freedom of movement and ability to change jobs without their employer's permission. This system allows abusive employers to control their workforce by canceling residence permits, falsely reporting employees as absconding, and using non-compete clauses to prevent workers from changing jobs.",
			"answer": "Amnesty International has documented several labor abuses in Qatar, particularly in relation to the kafala system. The kafala system is a sponsorship-based employment system that ties migrant workers to their employers, giving employers significant control over their workers' lives and rights. Here are some of the labor abuses documented:\n\n1. Exploitative working conditions: Migrant workers in Qatar often face long working hours, with some working up to 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week. They are also subjected to dangerous and hazardous working conditions, especially in the construction sector.\n\n2. Withheld wages: Many workers have reported that their employers withhold their wages for months, sometimes even years. This practice leaves workers in a vulnerable position, unable to leave their jobs or seek alternative employment.\n\n3. Passport confiscation: Employers often confiscate the passports of migrant workers, depriving them of their freedom of movement and making it difficult for them to leave the country or change jobs. This practice is a clear violation of workers' rights and leaves them trapped in exploitative situations.\n\n4. Forced labor and human trafficking: Amnesty International has documented cases of forced labor and human trafficking in Qatar. Some workers are deceived about the nature of their work or are forced to work against their will, often in conditions akin to modern-day slavery.\n\n5. Inadequate living conditions: Migrant workers in Qatar often live in overcrowded and unsanitary accommodation provided by their employers. These living conditions are substandard and do not meet basic human rights standards.\n\nThese labor abuses are directly linked to the kafala system, which gives employers excessive power and control over migrant workers. The system ties workers to their employers, making it difficult for them to assert their rights or seek redress for abuses. The kafala system creates a power imbalance that enables employers to exploit workers, leading to the documented labor abuses in Qatar.",
			"contexts": [
				"During the tournament, Amnesty International documented how one company providing guards to an international hotel chain in Doha was permitting workers only one day off each month, threatening salary cuts if they took more rest time, failing to provide pay slips and housing them in dirty and overcrowded accommodation with six people per room in bunkbeds.\nUntil 2020, Qatar\u2019s inherently abusive kafala sponsorship system imposed tight restrictions on migrant workers\u2019 freedom of movement, prohibiting them from leaving the country or changing jobs without the permission of their employer.\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the government took important steps towards tackling two central pillars of this system by repealing for most migrant workers the requirement to obtain from their employer an 'exit permit\u2019 to leave the country, and a \u2018no-objection certificate\u2019 (NOC) to change jobs.\nSuch reliance means abusive employers can \u2013 and still do \u2013 depend on an array of tools to control their workforce. This includes cancelling or refraining from renewing workers\u2019 residence permits, or falsely reporting employees as having \u201cabsconded\u201d from their job (when they could be trying to escape abuse) - all of which can lead to workers being arrested and deported.\nOther barriers to workers changing jobs freely have emerged over the last few years, limiting the impact of the reforms and maintaining the status quo. These include the unwritten \u2013 but often spoken \u2013 need for workers to secure \u201crelease papers\u201d, a resignation letter, or any equivalent of an NOC, from their current employers in order to successfully move jobs, and the malicious use by employers of the Labour Law\u2019s non-compete clause to effectively ban workers from changing jobs under the guise that they are going to work for direct competitors."

This includes cancelling or refraining from renewing workers\u2019 residence permits, or falsely reporting employees as having \u201cabsconded\u201d from their job (when they could be trying to escape abuse) - all of which can lead to workers being arrested and deported.\nOther barriers to workers changing jobs freely have emerged over the last few years, limiting the impact of the reforms and maintaining the status quo. These include the unwritten \u2013 but often spoken \u2013 need for workers to secure \u201crelease papers\u201d, a resignation letter, or any equivalent of an NOC, from their current employers in order to successfully move jobs, and the malicious use by employers of the Labour Law\u2019s non-compete clause to effectively ban workers from changing jobs under the guise that they are going to work for direct competitors.\nstatements: [\"Amnesty International has documented several labor abuses in Qatar.\", \"The documented labor abuses are particularly related to the kafala system.\", \"The kafala system is a sponsorship-based employment system.\", \"The kafala system ties migrant workers to their employers.\", \"The kafala system gives employers significant control over the lives and rights of workers.\", \"Migrant workers in Qatar often face long working hours.\", \"Some migrant workers work up to 12 hours a day.\", \"Migrant workers often work six or seven days a week.\", \"Migrant workers are subjected to dangerous and hazardous working conditions.\", \"Dangerous and hazardous working conditions are especially prevalent in the construction sector.\", \"Many workers have reported that employers withhold their wages for months.\", \"Some workers have reported that employers withhold their wages for years.\", \"Withholding wages leaves workers in a vulnerable position.\", \"Withholding wages makes it difficult for workers to leave their jobs or seek alternative employment.\", \"Employers often confiscate the passports of migrant workers.\", \"Confiscating passports deprives workers of their freedom of movement.\", \"Confiscating passports makes it difficult for workers to leave the country or change jobs.\", \"Confiscating passports is a clear violation of workers' rights.\", \"Confiscating passports leaves workers trapped in exploitative situations.\", \"Amnesty International has documented cases of forced labor and human trafficking in Qatar.\", \"Some workers are deceived about the nature of their work.\", \"Some workers are forced to work against their will.\", \"Some workers work in conditions akin to modern-day slavery.\", \"Migrant workers in Qatar often live in overcrowded and unsanitary accommodation.\", \"Accommodation for migrant workers is provided by employers.\", \"Living conditions for migrant workers are substandard.\", \"Living conditions for migrant workers do not meet basic human rights standards.\", \"Labor abuses are directly linked to the kafala system.\", \"The kafala system gives employers excessive power and control over migrant workers.\", \"The kafala system ties workers to their employers.\", \"Tying workers to employers makes it difficult for workers to assert their rights.\", \"Tying workers to employers makes it difficult for workers to seek redress for abuses.\", \"The kafala system creates a power imbalance.\", \"The power imbalance enables employers to exploit workers.\", \"The exploitation of workers leads to the documented labor abuses in Qatar.\"]\nanswer: \n",
